            <p>When the Scottish Qualifications Authority scores took a nosedive, Napier University unleashed a quirky plan to save the academic day: The Ultimate Brain Challenge. <span class="hover-red">Think of it as a brainy "Hunger Games," minus the cardio.</span>
<br><br>
                You, are invited to dive into a series of puzzles and memory tests. The prize? Your degree, a beacon of hope to dodge a lifetime in hospitality, where your crowning achievement might be the "Regretti Spaghetti" special.
                <br>  <br>          
                Armed with your wit (and a concerning amount of coffee), you're up against codes that make Sudoku look like knots and crosses and memory tests that challenge your existence. It's an adventure filled with laughs, late-night cramming, and inventive thinking, possibly just sleep deprivation in disguise.
                <br><br>
                As you stand on the threshold of this academic circus, ready to tackle the challenge head-on.

                One question remains...
